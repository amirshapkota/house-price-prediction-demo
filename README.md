# House Price Prediction

Simulated house data for price prediction (square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and a location factor) and calculate the price with some added randomness to make it more real.

Scikit-learn's linear regression model to predict the house prices based on the created features.

The model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE), trained using a linear regression algorithm.

After training, the model can predict the house prices for new data.

Actual vs predicted house prices is plotted to see the performance.

It shows the process of generating synthetic data, training a machine learning model, and evaluating its performance.
