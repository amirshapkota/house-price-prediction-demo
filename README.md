Simulated house data (square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and a location factor) and calculate the price with some added randomness to make it more real.

scikit-learn's linear regression model to predict the house prices based on the features.

The model is evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE)

After training, the model can predict house prices for new data.

actual vs predicted house prices is plotted to see the performance.
